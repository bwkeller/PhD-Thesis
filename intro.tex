On April 26, 1920, Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis took the stage at the
Smithsonian National Museum of History to debate each other on a topic of of
seemingly only academic interest: the nature of so-called ``Spiral Nebulae''.
The two eminent astronomers argued whether these nebulae were contained within
the Milky Way.  The implication if they lived within the Galaxy was that the
Galaxy was The Universe.  If they were not, the universe was far vaster than
most imagined.  This academic debate, like the Papal disagreement with Galileo
three hundred years earlier, was poised to reshape our understanding of the
vastness of the cosmos, and our insignificant place within it.

Today, nearly a century later, we no longer refer to these objects as ``Spiral
Nebulae'', but instead give them the name first reserved only for our own:
Galaxies.  Our Milky Way is but one of trillions of galaxies in the universe,
filling a volume that stretches out thousands of Megaparsecs in space and
billions of years in time.  These galaxies contain nearly all of the stars and
planets in the universe, much of the universe's gas, and are the places where
the former are constructed from the latter.

Understanding how galaxies form and evolve is therefore key to understanding the
origin of all the objects within them.
